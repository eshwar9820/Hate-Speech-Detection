# Hate-Speech-Detection

		Hate speech is currently of broad and current interest in the domain of social media. The anonymity and flexibility afforded by the Internet has made it easy for users to communicate in an aggressive manner. And as the amount of online hate speech is increasing, methods that automatically detect hate speech is very much required. Moreover, these problems have also been attracting the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning communities a lot. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to look at how Natural Language Processing applies in detecting hate speech. Furthermore, this project also applies a current technique in this field on a dataset. As neural network approaches outperform existing methods for text classification problems, a deep learning model has been introduced, namely the LSTM.

•	This project aim to detect the hate speech in social media like Facebook, Twitter using LSTM and NLP techniques.

•	Understanding of Natural Language Processing methodologies for hate speech detection.
